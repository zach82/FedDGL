# FedDGL

## Overview

Federated graph learning advances the field of federated learning by enabling privacy-preserving collaborative training on distributed graph data. Conventional federated graph learning methods excel in handling data heterogeneity but typically assume static graph data, whereas real-world graphs are dynamically changing. Combining traditional federated graph learning with dynamic graph neural networks can handle dynamic data but often neglects previously learned knowledge, reducing generalization for both global and personalized models. This paper introduces FedDGL, a novel framework that tackles the challenges of temporal evolution and data heterogeneity in federated dynamic graph learning. Unlike conventional methods, FedDGL captures temporal dynamics through a global knowledge distillation-based method and manages client heterogeneity via a global prototype-based regularization method. Our framework incorporates contrastive learning to generate global prototypes, enhancing feature representation. Additionally, it employs a prototype similarity-based personalized aggregation method for efficient adaptation to both local and global data distributions. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate FedDGL's significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 9.02% and 8.77% gains in local and global testing, respectively, compared to FedAvg. These findings underscore FedDGL's effectiveness in enhancing personalized and global model performance in dynamic, heterogeneous federated graph learning environments.

## Datasets and Settings

We provide datasets and preprocessing code used in the paper. The current `./data` contains datasets only for node classification, but datasets for temporal link prediction will be automatically downloaded at runtime.
